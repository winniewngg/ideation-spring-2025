# Chrome Extension Idea: [Title]

## Authors

## Problem Statement

When students and knowledge workers read online content—whether on Canvas, digital textbooks, or research articles—they often have to manually copy-paste text into a chatbot like ChatGPT to ask questions, generate summaries, or create study materials. This repetitive task breaks focus and makes prompt-based learning inefficient. Moreover, effective prompts are rarely saved or reused, causing users to retype or forget what worked before. This extension (maybe called Prompt-something) solves these pain points by allowing users to instantly send selected webpage content to customizable LLM prompts and save both the prompt and the output in a searchable personal history.

## Target Audience

The target audience would be students, researchers, and self-learners who engage often with digital content for studying, learning, or writing. They commonly use tools like ChatGPT and want to streamline their workflows. Most are familiar with browser extensions and want lightweight tools that enhance productivity, without introducing steep learning curves or having to juggle lots of applications.

## Description

This is a Chrome Extension that allows users to highlight content on any webpage, send it to an LLM with a pre-written or custom prompt, and store the interaction in a personal prompt-response library. It eliminates the need to copy-paste into separate windows and encourages the creation of reusable study tools based on real-time content.

## Selling Points

1. One-click LLM querying directly from any webpage without switching tabs or apps.
2. Custom and reusable prompts tailored to specific study or research goals.
3. Automatic saving of input and output into a searchable prompt history.
4. Lightweight interface designed to work seamlessly with platforms like Canvas, PDFs, and online textbooks.
5. Enhances study habits by making prompting more efficient, organized, and reflective.

## User Stories

As a student, I want to highlight text from an online reading and ask the LLM to simplify it so that I can better understand difficult concepts.
As a researcher, I want to summarize dense academic abstracts quickly so that I can skim papers more efficiently.
As a learner, I want to save my prompts and LLM responses so that I can reference useful explanations later.
As a user, I want to apply pre-written prompt templates so that I don't have to retype the same requests repeatedly.
As a student, I want to tag saved prompts by course or topic so that I can find related material easily.
As a student, I want to compare how different prompts affect LLM responses so that I can refine my study strategies over time.
As a user, I want to search through my saved prompt-response history so that I can quickly retrieve past explanations without repeating work.
As a learner, I want to export my saved prompts and outputs to a CSV or text file so that I can study offline or integrate them into other tools.
As a student, I want to customize prompt templates for different subjects so that the LLM gives responses aligned with the way each course is taught.
As a user, I want to pin or favorite certain responses so that I can keep the most helpful insights easily accessible.

## Notes
Personally haven’t developed an extension or anything similar before, so thought this is a feasible and within scope idea for a first time project that would fit within our time constraints. I think that the biggest challenge would be figuring out asynchronous API calls and also the issue of local storage.
